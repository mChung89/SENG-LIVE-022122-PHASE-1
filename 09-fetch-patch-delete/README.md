# Fetch: PATCH & DELETE

### Objectives

- Finish up POST with new comments form

- Make PATCH and DELETE requests using values submitted through Click events

- PATCH and DELETE objects using .fetch()

- Render new data to the DOM

### Using JSON Server

- For today's exercise, to start the JSON server, run `json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json` while in the directory that contains the `db.json` file i.e. `SENG-LIVE-022122-phase-1/09-fetch-patch-delete`
- For this project, we will use the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/characters`

### Deliverables

1. Complete the POST request with a new comment and render to the DOM

2. Make a PATCH request after the like button has been clicked to update the number of likes of the character.

3. Make a DELETE request after the delete button on a character card is clicked.
